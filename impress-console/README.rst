This module provides a speaker console for impress.js. It shows speaker notes,
a small view of the current slide, a preview of the next slide in order,
a clock and a resettable timer.

This started as an update of David Souther's notes.js, but is now not longer
recognizable as such, but some parts of his code remains.

Usage
=====

To use it put impressConsole.js in the js directory under your presentation, and
put impressConsole.css in the css directory under your presentation. The
console will look for css/impressConsole.css, so you need to locate it there.

Then add the following to the bottom of your presentation HTML::

    <script src="js/impressNotes.js"></script>
    
And add this to the script where you call impress.init()::

      notes().init();

You can then open the speaker window with the N key. You can also open it automatically with::

    notes().open();


All in all, the impress.js initialization at the end of the file hence should look something like this::

    <script src="js/impress.js"></script>
    <script src="js/impressConsole.js"></script>
    <script>
        impress().init();
        console().init();
        console().open(); // If you want them to open automatically
    </script>

The timer at the bottom of the screen starts automatically, and will reset if you click on it.
