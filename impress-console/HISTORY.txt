HISTORY
=======

1.0b3 - Unreleased
------------------

- Added a "Ready/Working" status flag.

1.0b2 - 2012-04-01
------------------

- The "pre-loading" of notes loaded the wrong notes.

- Added key handlers in the console, so that navigation works even if the
  console window has focus. Tab is not supported, as that will trigger 
  the next slide also when you Alt-Tab in some browsers, which is extremely
  annoying.
  
- The windows in the presenter console will now move in sync with the main
  window (unless you move to a step before the previous one has finished
  moving, in which case the presenter console will fall behind).
  

1.0b1 - 2012-03-30
------------------

- Initial release.
